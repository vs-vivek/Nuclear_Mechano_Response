## Typical scenarios

- **Time-dependent adhesion disassembly**: Use the time-dependent model and adjust the contractility and adhesion disassembly slope parameters to specify the desired decay rate. To compare scenarios with or without fibrillar adhesions, toggle the adhesion node on or off during simulation.
