# Instructions for COMSOL Models Directory

This directory contains three COMSOL model files, each representing a distinct simulation or study related to nuclear mechano-response. Below is an overview of the contents and their significance:

## List of Files

1. **Model_Sensitivity_Analysis**  
   This file contains the already completed Sensitivity Analysis model. It is implemented in a stationary state setting with the objective function as nuclear height.
2. **Nuclear_Vimentin_Interaction.mph**  
   The second file includes models for adhesion disassembly simulations.

3. **thickbot_stretch_v2_stationary.mph**  
   The third file contain the Stretch Simulation model.
## Significance

- Each file is designed to help users reproduce, modify, or extend different aspects of the nuclear mechano-response simulations.
- The models can be opened using COMSOL Multiphysics software.
- Users should refer to the model notes inside each file for specific simulation details, mesh settings, and solver configurations.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure COMSOL Multiphysics is installed on your system.
2. Open each `.mph` file in COMSOL to explore the geometry, physics settings, and results.
3. Modify the parameters as needed for your study or experimental setup.

If you have questions about the usage or setup of these files, please refer to the documentation or contact the repository maintainers.
